        <h2>Fun Facts About ME</h2>
        <div class = "wrapper">
          <article class = "facts">
            <h3>Fact #1</a></h3>
            <h4>I used to teach English and poetry.</h4>
            <img src="http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/174/6/0/wkuk___i_don__t_care_by_vaughnstump-d3jqoug.gif" alt="Ada Lovelace" />
            <p>I taught at different colleges for a few years before realizing that it was not the right path for me. <br/><br/>Me: "I don't care what Wikipedia says." <br/><br/>Student: "Can I still use it as a source for everything and anything that I want to find out about life? And will I get an 'A' even though you explicitly told us to use academic sources?" <br/> <br/> (Don't get me wrong, I love Wikipedia too. But these kids be crazy hooked; they're all "I know it's true cuz I saw it online and no matter what YOU say YOU'RE not Wiki.")</p>
          </article>
          <article class = "facts">
            <h3>Fact #2</h3>
            <h4>I don't know how to ride a bike.</h4>
            <img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1381111369/4238814.gif"/>
            <p>I tried to learn a few times throughout my life, but the above is always what happens. I once rode on a tandem bike with my husband on Mackinac Island (I was in the back seat), and it was the best ever. Not so fun for him though. It's also not that easy to learn to ride a bike in adulthood, I've noticed. One of my friends suggested that I purchase training wheels and learn that way. Can you imagine a grown woman riding a grown-up bike with training wheels? I'd totally do it drunk, but otherwise...</p>

            <h3>Fact #3</h3>
            <h4>I'm originally from Kiev, Ukraine.</h4>
            <img src="unit1_week1/images/2951248-3.jpg"/>
            <p>My family and I came to the U.S. when I was 5 years old, and I've been in Chicago ever since.</p>

            <img src="http://cutearoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Kitten11.jpg"/>
            <p>Yes, I love cats, now stop judging me. I also love poetry, all types of reading, politics, history, gender studies, FOOD,  the outdoors in nice weather, and all things tech related. And here's a shout-out to my hubby so he doesn't get sad: <a ref="http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/">Love you.</a></p>

            <h3>The Motherland</h3>

            <p>So that's Kiev, the capital. When I lived there it was still the USSR. That's why I speak Russian, not Ukrainian. There's some serious shit going down in Ukraine right now, and here is a good source to answer some of your questions, in case you have any: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2014/03/04/5-important-facts-that-the-western-press-is-getting-terribly-wrong-in-ukraine/" target="_blank">Click Me Please!</a></p>
