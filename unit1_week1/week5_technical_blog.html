      <h4>Let's build a new Ruby app with classes!</h4>

	  <div id="main">
      <p>I love traveling, but I HATE being a tourist. I always wish that I knew some locals that could show me around, or tell me the cool places to go see, or just guide me toward things locals like to do. I prefer to experience places for what they are, instead of hitting up all the usual tourist traps. From this frustration, my little baby was born: I call her <em>Lokalizr</em>.</p>

      <p>Lokalizr is supposed to be an app that bridges the gap between travel and comfort. I don't speak Japanese, but I want to go to Japan! I don't know anyone in Japan :(. You know what would be cool? A local guide! That spoke some English! He/she could sit down with me in Tokyo and explain some things, maybe show me around, maybe we'd have lunch, etc. I would be the tourist, but I'd be touring the city through the eyes of a local. Or even better, I want to move to Tokyo! Oh hell, I can search online forever for tips, but wouldn't it be nice talking to someone that could answer my personal questions? Maybe talking to a few people? </p>

      <p>That's the basic idea of the app. So how do we build this thing? The first thing we should do is talk about objects and classes.</p>

      <h5>WHAT IS AN OBJECT?</h5>

        <blockquote>"An object is an entity that serves as a container for data and also controls access to the data. Associated with an object is a set of attributes, which are essentially no more than variables belonging to that object. Also associated with an object is a set of functions that provide an interface to the functionality of the object, called methods." - Hal Fulton</blockquote>


        <p>Remember how almost everything in Ruby is an object? Think of an object as a jar (or container, as mentioned above). The jar stores a bunch of things inside it, and we can do certain things with the jar as well. So in our app, we'd need to build some objects that would store data, and that we can manipulate. What would those objects be? Classes, of course!</p>

        <h5>WHAT IS A CLASS?</h5>

        <blockquote>"A class is just a way of organizing and producing objects with similar attributes and methods." - codeacademy.com</blockquote>

        <p>What does this mean, though? It means that a class is an object, and that you can have instances of that class (which are also objects). For example: <br /><br />

          class Dog<br />
          end <br /><br />

          fido = Dog.new("golden retriever")<br />
          jumpy = Dog.new("beagle")<br />
          fluffy = Dog.new("yorkshire terrier")</p>

        <p>Dog would be the entire class, and fido, jumpy, and fluffy would be INSTANCES of that class, but they are all objects.</p>

        <p>This leads up into discussing variables, because we need to understand how to use these new classes and objects we're going to create. </p>
        
<blockquote>"Ruby provides four types of variables:

Local Variables: Local variables are the variables that are defined in a method. Local variables are not available outside the method. You will see more details about method in subsequent chapter. Local variables begin with a lowercase letter or _. <br /><br />

Instance Variables: Instance variables are available across methods for any particular instance or object. That means that instance variables change from object to object. Instance variables are preceded by the at sign (@) followed by the variable name.<br /><br />

Class Variables: Class variables are available across different objects. A class variable belongs to the class and is a characteristic of a class. They are preceded by the sign @@ and are followed by the variable name.<br /><br />

Global Variables: Class variables are not available across classes. If you want to have a single variable, which is available across classes, you need to define a global variable. The global variables are always preceded by the dollar sign ($)." - tutorialspoint.com </blockquote>


<p>Things an object knows about itself are the instance variables. They represent an object's state (the data - for example, the quantity and the product id), and can have unique values for each object of that type. Class variables, however, are not unique to each particular object; they are a constant in every object. Be careful when creating global variables: most of the time they're very discouraged. That's why the above explanation of the 4 different types of variables is important. </p>

<p>The next important element to understand are methods, which are things an object can do. There are class methods and there are instance methods. Sometimes a class needs to provide methods that work without being tied to any particular object, and that's why class methods come in handy. Things like deleting and even creating are class-level methods, because they need to work on every instance of that class. Instance methods are called on particular instances of a class, like called fido.bark. If you want ALL your dogs to bark, then build it like this: self.bark. If you want only some dogs to bark, and the rest to sit quietly, then define your method like so: bark. The "self" keyword means it will work on every single object that you create from that class, which is not always desired.</p> 

<p>Now let's talk inheritance (not money, sorry). </p>

<blockquote>"Some object-oriented languages (notably C++) support multiple inheritance, where a class can have more than one immediate parent, inheriting functionality from each. Although powerful, this technique can be dangerous, as the inheritance hierarchy can become ambiguous.

Other languages, such as Java, support single inheritance. Here, a class can have only one immediate parent. Although cleaner (and easier to implement), single inheritance also has drawbacksâ€”in the real world things often inherit attributes from multiple sources (a ball is both a bouncing thing and a spherical thing, for example).

Ruby offers an interesting and powerful compromise, giving you the simplicity of single inheritance and the power of multiple inheritance. A Ruby class can have only one direct parent, and so Ruby is a single-inheritance language. However, Ruby classes can include the functionality of any number of mixins (a mixin is like a partial class definition). This provides a controlled multiple-inheritance-like capability with none of the drawbacks." - phrogz.net</blockquote>

<p>Here's an info graphic about classes and inheritance. Check out this craziness:<br /><br /></p>

    margin-right: auto; display:block;">

<p>Let's relate this all back to my app. If I had a class named "User", I could have sub-classes that inherited certain attributes from "User". Here is an example of something I built, that is only really half-ready (also, it uses some Rails methods solely for semantic purposes, so please ignore):</p>

<xmp style="background-color: #C4B7B7; padding: 5%;">
#Lokalizr


class User

  def initialize(name, age, state, city, email)
    @name = name
    @age = age
    @state = state
    @city = city
    @email = email
    @@users = 0
  end

attr_accessor :name, :age, :state, :city, :email

def self.delete #class method
   User.find(:id).destroy
end 

def register(username, password, id, email, city, state) #instance method
  if username.valid? && password.valid? && email.valid?
     redirect_to "welcome_page"
  else
     raise Error "Please check the fields and re-enter your information."
  end
    @@users += 1
end

def login(username,password)
  if User.find(:username, :password)
     sign_in_and_redirect_to "home_page"
    else
      raise AuthenticationError "Please check your username and password."
    end
  end
  
def profile(gender, picture, survey, about_me)
  #code that redirects to upload picture, fill out bio, and answer survey
end


class Guide < User

  def initialize(rating)
    super (name, age, state, city, email)
    @rating = rating
    @@guides = 0
  end

  def give_rating(rate_guide)
    @rating += rate_guide
  end

  private

  def self.see_my_rating
    puts "Your rating is #{@rating}"
  end
end

class Tourist < User

  def initialize(rating)
     super (name, age, state, city, email)
     @rating = rating
    @@tourists = 0
  end
  
  def give_rating(rate_tourist)
    @rating += rate_tourist
  end

  private

  def self.see_my_rating
    puts "Your rating is #{@rating}"
  end

end

class New_Resident < User

  def initialize(rating)
    super (name, age, state, city, email)
    @rating = rating
    @@tourists = 0
  end
  
  def give_rating(rate_resident)
    @rating += rate_resident
  end

  private

  def self.see_my_rating
    puts "Your rating is #{@rating}"
  end
end

</xmp>
 

 <p>As you can see, I've structured it so that the sub-classes "Tourist", "Guide", and "New Resident" inherit from "User", because they are all a type of user. There are also two different kinds of methods that we talked about above: instance methods and class methods. It makes sense that you'll want to delete any instance of a class without restraint (like deleting your user profile or a tweet), but that something like giving and getting a user rating are tied to individual instances of a class (I might have a higher rating than you do, or vice versa). </p>

 <p>Lastly, the keyword "private" that I used above deserves some attention, as does the keyword attr_accessor. </p>

 <p>Sometimes you need to access certain attributes. In my Lokalizr app, I want the user to be able to change their name, age, state, city, and email address. It would be illogical to never let my users update their info. In order to access their info, that is, to be able to read it and overwrite it, I need the attribute accessor keyword, or attr_accessor for short. Instead of writing out methods for each attribute, it only takes one line of code!</p>

 <p>Private, on the other hand, is meant to limit access. In the above example, I DO NOT want people messing with the ratings that others give them, otherwise we'd all have the best reviews. Here is a another way of thinking about public vs. private methods:</p>

 <blockquote>"Private methods are just that: they're private to the object where they are
defined. This means you can only call these methods from other code inside
the object. Another way to say this is that the method cannot be called with an explicit receiver. Explicit receivers are the objects on which methods are called! Whenever you call object.method, object is the receiver of the method. In order to access private information, we have to create public methods that know how to get it. This separates the private implementation from the public interface." - codeacademy.com</blockquote>
