       <h4>How To Manage Your Time and Still Eat, Sleep, and Have Bathroom Breaks.</h4>

    <div id="main">
     
     <p>I suck at time management. I've known this since I was little. I'm a procrastinator with a capital "FML", meaning sometimes I put things off until the last minute because I'm either: 1. bored, 2. watching <i>Game of Thrones</i>, or 3. scared of failure. Due to the fact that I've struggled with this my entire life, I'm always looking for ways to trick myself into doing things not just on time, but in a timely manner. This is how I stumbled upon the Pomodoro Technique.</p>

     <p>Never heard of it, you say? Well, without further ado, here it is:</p>

    <iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CT70iCaG0Gs" style="display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
     
     <p style="padding-top: 2%;">If you've furrowed your brow because you can't believe a grown-up has problems with time management, then you will not be impressed by the above video. You are a cold, calculating, heartless machine that has zero friends on facebook, because you would otherwise be incessantly checking their updates about which new lunch spot has the best tacos. You have also never discovered kitten videos, or worse, don't like cats.</p>

     <p>I'm of course only half joking. The real purpose of this method is the following, taken from pomodorotechnique.com:</p>

     1. WORK WITH TIME - NOT AGAINST IT<br /><br />

For many people, time is an enemy. We race against the clock to finish assignments and meet deadlines. The Pomodoro Technique teaches you to work with time, instead of struggling against it. A revolutionary time management system, it is at once deceptively simple to learn and life-changing to use.

2. ELIMINATE BURNOUT<br /><br />

Essential to the Pomodoro Technique is the notion that taking short, scheduled breaks while working eliminates the “running on fumes” feeling you get when you’ve pushed yourself too hard. It’s impossible to over work when you stick to the system. You may end up taking fewer sick days, too!

3. MANAGE DISTRACTIONS<br /><br />

Whether it’s a call, a Facebook message, or suddenly realizing you need to change the oil in your car, many distracting thoughts and events come up when you’re at work. The Pomodoro Technique will help you log your distractions and order them according to priority levels. Often, they can wait.

4. CREATE A BETTER WORK / LIFE BALANCE<br /><br />

Most of us are intimately acquainted with the guilt that comes from procrastinating. If we haven’t had a productive day, it’s pretty easy to end up feeling like we can’t enjoy our free time. Becoming a Pomodoro Master involves creating an effective timetable, allowing you to truly enjoy your time off.</blockquote>
