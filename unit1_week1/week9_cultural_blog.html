       <h4>How To Manage Your Time and Still Eat, Sleep, and Have Bathroom Breaks.</h4>

    <div id="main">
     
     <p>I suck at time management. I've known this since I was little. I'm a procrastinator with a capital "FML", meaning sometimes I put things off until the last minute because I'm either: 1. bored, 2. watching <i>Game of Thrones</i>, or 3. scared of failure. Due to the fact that I've struggled with this my entire life, I'm always looking for ways to trick myself into doing things not just on time, but in a timely manner. This is how I stumbled upon the Pomodoro Technique.</p>

     <p>Never heard of it, you say? Well, without further ado, here it is:</p>

     <p style="padding-top: 2%;">If you've furrowed your brow because you can't believe a grown-up has problems with time management, then you will not be impressed by the above video. You are a cold, calculating, heartless machine that has zero friends on Facebook, because you would otherwise be incessantly checking their updates about which new lunch spot has the best tacos. You have also never discovered kitten videos, or worse, don't like cats.</p>

     <p>I'm of course only half joking. The real purpose of this method is the following, taken from pomodorotechnique.com:</p>

     1. WORK WITH TIME - NOT AGAINST IT<br /><br />

For many people, time is an enemy. We race against the clock to finish assignments and meet deadlines. The Pomodoro Technique teaches you to work with time, instead of struggling against it. A revolutionary time management system, it is at once deceptively simple to learn and life-changing to use.<br /><br /><br /><br />

2. ELIMINATE BURNOUT<br /><br />

Essential to the Pomodoro Technique is the notion that taking short, scheduled breaks while working eliminates the “running on fumes” feeling you get when you’ve pushed yourself too hard. It’s impossible to over work when you stick to the system. You may end up taking fewer sick days, too!<br /><br /><br /><br />

3. MANAGE DISTRACTIONS<br /><br />

Whether it’s a call, a Facebook message, or suddenly realizing you need to change the oil in your car, many distracting thoughts and events come up when you’re at work. The Pomodoro Technique will help you log your distractions and order them according to priority levels. Often, they can wait.<br /><br /><br /><br />

4. CREATE A BETTER WORK / LIFE BALANCE<br /><br />

Most of us are intimately acquainted with the guilt that comes from procrastinating. If we haven’t had a productive day, it’s pretty easy to end up feeling like we can’t enjoy our free time. Becoming a Pomodoro Master involves creating an effective timetable, allowing you to truly enjoy your time off.</blockquote>


<p>Honestly, who wouldn't want a better work/life balance, or to eliminate burnout? These things are particularly important when transitioning from one career into another, very technical one. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm trying to learn as much as possible as fast as possible, and the probability of burnout is very high. There have been days that I've had to, although begrudgingly, admit to myself that I am incapable of learning anything else and need to take a break. This is where this awesome technique comes in handy. I usually feel super guilty about taking breaks, which leads to extended breaks because the reasoning goes something like this "Well, I've already wasted X amount of time, I might as well look through a few more Buzzfeed lists." The Pomodoro technique helped me combat this, and here lifehack.org explains how: </p>

<blockquote>
Frequent breaks keep your mind fresh and focused. According to the official Pomodoro website, the system is easy to use and you will see results very quickly: “You will probably begin to notice a difference in your work or study process within a day or two. True mastery of the technique takes from seven to twenty days of constant use.”

If you have a large and varied to-do list, using the Pomodoro Technique can help you crank through projects faster by forcing you to adhere to strict timing. Watching the timer wind down can spur you to wrap up your current task more quickly, and spreading a task over two or three pomodoros can keep you from getting frustrated. The constant timing of your activities makes you more accountable for your tasks, and minimizes the time you spend procrastinating. You’ll grow to “respect the tomato”, and that can help you to better handle your workload.
</blockquote>

<p>I've also read in several sources that pair-programming can benefit from using this method, because it's very similar to agile development techniques like time-boxed iterations, review at the end of the day, and feedback to improve for the next day; moreover, the goal is to maintain a sustainable pace (agileworld.blogspot.com).</p>


<p>Lastly, I'll leave you with another video. It explains a bit of history about the Pomodoro Technique, and also outlines more clearly how to try it yourself. Here's to being proactive and productive; and to spending your breaks however you see fit (like scrolling through your favorite kitten gifs. Well helllllooooo little precious ball of innocence! Let's see you jump into that Kleenex box a few more times.)</p>
