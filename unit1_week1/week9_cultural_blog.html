       <h4>How To Manage Your Time and Still Eat, Sleep, and Have Bathroom Breaks.</h4>

     <p>I suck at time management. I've known this since I was little. I'm a procrastinator with a capital "FML", meaning sometimes I put things off until the last minute because I'm either: 1. bored, 2. watching <i>Game of Thrones</i>, or 3. scared of failure. Due to the fact that I've struggled with this my entire life, I'm always looking for ways to trick myself into doing things not just on time, but in a timely manner. This is how I stumbled upon the Pomodoro Technique.</p>

     <p>Never heard of it, you say? Well, without further ado, here it is:</p>

    <iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CT70iCaG0Gs" style="display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
     
     <p style="padding-top: 2%;">If you've furrowed your brow because you can't believe a grown-up has problems with time management, then you will not be impressed by the above video. You are a cold, calculating, heartless machine that has zero friends on facebook, because you would otherwise be incessantly checking their updates about which new lunch spot has the best tacos. You have also never discovered kitten videos, or worse, don't like cats.</p>
