      <blockquote> "The tech industry has a well-documented pipeline problem, one largely the result of gender stereotypes that reach into the educational system." <br />-Soraya Chemaly </blockquote>

      <h4>Women are under-represented in all tech fields, from start-ups, to programmers, to management-level positions. What's the problem, and does it have an answer?</h4>

  		<p>A few months ago I attended a JavaScript meet-up. The topic was high performance JavaScript, which promised to be an exciting learning opportunity. I've only just begun my long journey into coding/development, but I try to attend talks that are way over my head in order to then go home and research everything I didn't quite understand. This particular talk was huge; the event was at capacity, and about 80-90 people showed up.</p> 

      <p>The first thing I did when I showed up was to look for a seat somewhere in the middle of the room. I HATE sitting at the back of a room for a presention, and all the spaces at the front had been taken. I saw some empty seats, but I didn't pick one at random, because the second thing I did was to try to spot another woman. Some people might find this to be ridiculous - why would you look for another women when picking your seat? It's only an hour talk, does it matter that much?</p> 

      <p>The truth is: it matters to me. I'm frequently the ONLY woman at technical meet-ups, and so I always look for other women before I sit down. There aren't as many of us as I'd like there to be, so when I spot a woman I like to sit next to her and ask her questions about her field: what is she working on, where does she work, what are her tech interests? Of course I'll talk to men as well, and I have no discomfort with men, but it's different speaking with someone that is also as keenly aware as you are that you're in the drastic minority.</p> 

      <p>At this JS talk I picked a seat right in front of a woman, and then proceeded to amiably chat with her and the guy next to me about our JS experience before the presentation started. While talking, I mentioned that I was going to attend DBC. The man in front of me heard this, and turned around. He said, and I quote verbatim, "You're learning to be a developer? I thought you were a recruiter. I mean, you're pretty, and you're friendly, so I just assumed." </p>

      <p>Whoa. I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't offended enough, or comfortable enough, to go off on him. And I fully understand that he wasn't trying to be mean or offensive. BUT COME THE FUCK ON. Some people need a reality check, and here it is: </p>

      <p>The amount of women in Computer Science is DECLINING. Wtf? There are so many sources that discuss the lack of women in tech that I have enough reading material for 2 lifetimes. Here's one from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/15/opinion/chemaly-tech-leaves-out-women/">CNN about women being ignored in tech fields.</a> Here's another (excellent) article about what it's like to be the first female anything (project manager, software lead, etc.):<a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3008216/tracking/minding-gap-how-your-company-can-woo-female-coders">The Loneliness Of The Female Coder.</a> Here's yet another from the New York Times that explains <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/technology/18women.html?pagewanted=all">how and why women are out of the loop in Silicon Vally</a>. Are there more, you say? Crain's Chicago Business discusses the <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140125/ISSUE02/301259997/technology-a-lack-of-role-models-limits-womens-progress">lack of female role models</a> and how it limits women's progress. NPR recently aired a segment that revealed that "Women-led businesses probably only receive between 5 and 10 percent of all the venture capital that's allocated to startups in their very earliest in their growth phases." A study was conducted to test why women get less funding. <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/03/22/292467848/need-money-for-your-startup-being-an-attractive-male-may-help">The results?</a> ATROCIOUS.  </p>
