      <h4>Women are under-represented in all tech fields, from start-ups, to programmers, to management-level positions. What's the problem, and does it have an answer?</h4>
      

	  <section>
  		<p>A few months ago I attended a JavaScript meet-up. The topic was high performance JavaScript, which promised to be an exciting learning opportunity. I've only just begun my long journey into coding/development, but I try to attend talks that are way over my head in order to then go home and research everything I didn't quite understand. This particular talk was huge; the event was at capacity, and about 80-90 people showed up.</p> 

      <p>The first thing I did when I showed up was to look for a seat somewhere in the middle of the room. I HATE sitting at the back of a room for a presention, and all the spaces at the front had been taken. I saw some empty seats, but I didn't pick one at random, because the second thing I did was to try to spot another woman. Some people might find this to be ridiculous - why would you look for another women when picking your seat? It's only an hour talk, does it matter that much?</p> 

      <p>The truth is: it matters to me. I'm frequently the ONLY woman at technical meet-ups, and so I always look for other women before I sit down. There aren't as many of us as I'd like there to be, so when I spot a woman I like to sit next to her and ask her questions about her field: what is she working on, where does she work, what are her tech interests? Of course I'll talk to men as well, and I have no discomfort with men, but it's different speaking with someone that is also as keenly aware as you are that you're in the drastic minority.</p> 

      <p>At this JS talk I picked a seat right in front of a woman, and then proceeded to amiably chat with her and the guy next to me about our JS experience before the presentation started. While talking, I mentioned that I was going to attend DBC. The man in front of me heard this, and turned around. He said, and I quote verbatim, "You're learning to be a developer? I thought you were a recruiter. I mean, you're pretty, and you're friendly, so I just assumed." </p>

      <p>Whoa. I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't offended enough, or comfortable enough, to go off on him. And I fully understand that he wasn't trying to be mean or offensive. BUT COME THE FUCK ON. Some people need a reality check, and here it is: </p>

      <p>The amount of women in Computer Science is DECLINING. Wtf? There are so many sources that discuss the lack of women in tech that I have enough reading material for 2 lifetimes. Here's one from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/15/opinion/chemaly-tech-leaves-out-women/">CNN about women being ignored in tech fields.</a> Here's another (excellent) article about what it's like to be the first female anything (project manager, software lead, etc.):<a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3008216/tracking/minding-gap-how-your-company-can-woo-female-coders">The Loneliness Of The Female Coder.</a> Here's yet another from the New York Times that explains <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/technology/18women.html?pagewanted=all">how and why women are out of the loop in Silicon Vally</a>. Are there more, you say? Crain's Chicago Business discusses the <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140125/ISSUE02/301259997/technology-a-lack-of-role-models-limits-womens-progress">lack of female role models</a> and how it limits women's progress. NPR recently aired a segment that revealed that "Women-led businesses probably only receive between 5 and 10 percent of all the venture capital that's allocated to startups in their very earliest in their growth phases." A study was conducted to test why women get less funding. <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/03/22/292467848/need-money-for-your-startup-being-an-attractive-male-may-help">The results?</a> ATROCIOUS.  </p>

      <p>Ok, so why? Why are women so under-represented? Why do they not pursue careers in tech at the same rate as men do? Other than the usual suspects (like gender-bias, unequal pay, no role-models, not encouraged in schools, etc.), here's what I found that makes my blood boil: <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/this-is-why-there-arent-enough-women-in-tech-1221929631" style="color: #fff">This Is Why There Aren't Enough Women In Tech.</a> This article was mind-blowing for me, because while I expect this shit elsewhere (academia, for example, or government), it's outragous that this kind of treatment happens in so-called liberal, progressive, open-minded, cutting-edge environments. What kind of treatment, you ask? Here are some experiences from women that ARE in tech: </p>

      <blockquote>1. <br />I no longer touch code because I couldn't deal with the constant dismissing and undermining of even my most basic work by the "brogramming" gulag I worked for. And that started even when I was in school. I was the ONLY female in my university's mid-level programming courses and even though I worked to hard to always be in the top 95% of the curve, if a pasty white guy with thin-rimmed glasses and a tee-shirt with an "ironic" phrase doubted me, I was wrong. I spent my life around midWestern dudes and high school jocks, but there is no misogyny like silicon valley nerd misogyny.  </blockquote>

      <blockquote>2. <br />I'm a programmer who happens to be female (and without the CS degree). As far as I can tell, it's self selection - the women in the field tend to have a higher tolerance for the male-dominated 'culture'. I'm regularly asked by women from other departments how I can stand it, after they've spent any time working with engineering. Not that my coworkers are ogres, just that they are often under the mistaken impression that they work in a true meritocracy. (Although I have worked with a fair few ogres in the past, from which I have not entirely recovered.)

      In regards to the open source projects - I've been thinking about this recently. I actually haven't committed to any and it definitely puts a kink in my career. It's not that I don't want to, or that I am lazy (much), but near as I can tell, they are entirely groups of friends / ex colleagues. I feel like it's a circle I can't get into. But mostly I fear the excessive spotlight of being a sole female programmer on a publicly available project. In light of how women are treated on the internet, this fear does not seem unreasonable.</blockquote> 

      <blockquote>3. <br />I have a sometimes-mentor that's a woman who has started several tech start-ups. The stories she's told me from VC meetings are horrifying. VCs straight-up refusing to talk to her, blatantly propositioning her in exchange for funding, or literally asking her to bring a man to the meeting "so she has a tech consult" (she's brilliant at tech with a track record to prove it). Seriously, this shit is endemic. </blockquote>

      <p>These kinds of anecdotes make me very nervous. I'm aware that this doesn't happen all the time, and that many women work at wondeful places and love their co-workers. But I have to say, it makes sense as to why a lot of women take one look at this field and go: Nope. I don't point the finger at men, mind you; I point the finger at the kind of culture that is propogated at some places. Being a minority at your place of work doesn't HAVE to be stressful, but unfortuntaely the onus falls on the majority making the environment less threatening, not on the minority. </p>

      <p>How about some solutions to this problem. Well, </p>
