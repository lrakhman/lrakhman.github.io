      <h4>Women are under-represented in all tech fields, from start-ups, to web development, to management-level positions. What's the problem, and does it have an answer?</h4>
      

    <div id="main">
      <p>A few months ago I attended a JavaScript meet-up. The topic was high performance JavaScript, which promised to be an exciting learning opportunity. I've only just begun my long journey into coding/development, but I try to attend talks that are way over my head in order to then go home and research everything I didn't quite understand. This particular talk was huge; the event was at capacity, and about 80-90 people showed up.</p> 

      <p>The first thing I did when I showed up was to look for a seat somewhere in the middle of the room. I HATE sitting at the back of a room for a presentation, and all the spaces at the front had been taken. I saw some empty seats, but I didn't pick one at random, because the second thing I did was to try to spot another woman. Some people might find this to be ridiculous - why would you look for another women when picking your seat? It's only an hour talk, does it matter that much?</p> 

      <p>The truth is: it matters to me. I'm frequently the ONLY woman at technical meet-ups (there were 7 woman at this one), and so I always look for other women before I sit down. There aren't as many of us as I'd like there to be, so when I spot a woman I like to sit next to her and ask her questions about her field: what is she working on, where does she work, what are her tech interests? Of course I'll talk to men as well, and I have no discomfort with men, but it's different speaking with someone that is also as keenly aware as you are that you're in the drastic minority.</p> 

      <p>At this JS talk I picked a seat right in front of a woman, and then proceeded to amiably chat with her and the guy next to me about our JS experience before the presentation started. While talking, I mentioned that I was going to attend DBC. The man in front of me heard this, and turned around. He said, and I quote verbatim, "You're learning to be a developer? I thought you were a recruiter. I mean, you're pretty, and you're friendly, so I just assumed." </p>

      <p>Whoa. What did you assume, dude? That a blonde, friendly woman doesn't have enough intelligence to handle some code? Oh my, look at these machines! Would you mind showing me how to turn it on? There are SO many buttons, how do you remember all this stuff? My frail brain is getting a headache just from watching all these little numbers and letters scroll across the screen. I'm gonna go do something I KNOW how to handle: shoe shopping!</p>

      <p>I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't offended enough, or comfortable enough, to go off on him. The above dialogue was yelled at him in silence, with a smile and an "Um, thanks?" And I fully understand that he wasn't trying to be mean or offensive. BUT COME THE FUCK ON. Some people need a reality check, and here it is: </p>

      <p>The amount of women in Computer Science is DECLINING. Wtf? There are so many sources that discuss the lack of women in tech that I have enough reading material for 2 lifetimes. Here's one from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/15/opinion/chemaly-tech-leaves-out-women/">CNN about women being ignored in tech fields.</a> Here's another (excellent) article about what it's like to be the first female anything (project manager, software lead, etc.):<a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3008216/tracking/minding-gap-how-your-company-can-woo-female-coders">The Loneliness Of The Female Coder.</a> Here's yet another from the New York Times that explains <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/technology/18women.html?pagewanted=all">how and why women are out of the loop in Silicon Valley</a>. Are there more, you say? Crain's Chicago Business discusses the <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140125/ISSUE02/301259997/technology-a-lack-of-role-models-limits-womens-progress">lack of female role models</a> and how it limits women's progress. NPR recently aired a segment that revealed that "Women-led businesses probably only receive between 5 and 10 percent of all the venture capital that's allocated to startups in their very earliest in their growth phases." A study was conducted to test why women get less funding. <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/03/22/292467848/need-money-for-your-startup-being-an-attractive-male-may-help">The results?</a> ATROCIOUS.  </p>

      <p>Ok, so why? Why are women so under-represented? Why do they not pursue careers in tech at the same rate as men do? Other than the usual suspects (like gender-bias, unequal pay, no role-models, not encouraged in schools, etc.), here's what I found that makes my blood boil: <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/this-is-why-there-arent-enough-women-in-tech-1221929631" style="color: #fff">This Is Why There Aren't Enough Women In Tech.</a> This article was mind-blowing for me, because while I expect this shit elsewhere (academia, for example, or government), it's outrageous that this kind of treatment happens in so-called liberal, progressive, open-minded, cutting-edge environments. What kind of treatment, you ask? Here are some experiences from women that ARE in tech: </p>

      <blockquote>1. <br />I no longer touch code because I couldn't deal with the constant dismissing and undermining of even my most basic work by the "brogramming" gulag I worked for. And that started even when I was in school. I was the ONLY female in my university's mid-level programming courses and even though I worked to hard to always be in the top 95% of the curve, if a pasty white guy with thin-rimmed glasses and a tee-shirt with an "ironic" phrase doubted me, I was wrong. I spent my life around midWestern dudes and high school jocks, but there is no misogyny like silicon valley nerd misogyny.  </blockquote>

      <blockquote>2. <br />I'm a programmer who happens to be female (and without the CS degree). As far as I can tell, it's self selection - the women in the field tend to have a higher tolerance for the male-dominated 'culture'. I'm regularly asked by women from other departments how I can stand it, after they've spent any time working with engineering. Not that my coworkers are ogres, just that they are often under the mistaken impression that they work in a true meritocracy. (Although I have worked with a fair few ogres in the past, from which I have not entirely recovered.)

      In regards to the open source projects - I've been thinking about this recently. I actually haven't committed to any and it definitely puts a kink in my career. It's not that I don't want to, or that I am lazy (much), but near as I can tell, they are entirely groups of friends / ex colleagues. I feel like it's a circle I can't get into. But mostly I fear the excessive spotlight of being a sole female programmer on a publicly available project. In light of how women are treated on the internet, this fear does not seem unreasonable.</blockquote> 

      <blockquote>3. <br />I have a sometimes-mentor that's a woman who has started several tech start-ups. The stories she's told me from VC meetings are horrifying. VCs straight-up refusing to talk to her, blatantly propositioning her in exchange for funding, or literally asking her to bring a man to the meeting "so she has a tech consult" (she's brilliant at tech with a track record to prove it). Seriously, this shit is endemic. </blockquote>

      <p>These kinds of anecdotes make me very nervous. I'm aware that this doesn't happen all the time, and that many women work at wonderful places and love their co-workers. But I have to say, it makes sense as to why a lot of women take one look at this field and go: Nope. I don't point the finger at men, mind you; I point the finger at the kind of culture that is propagated at some places. Being a minority at your place of work doesn't HAVE to be stressful, but unfortunately the onus falls on the majority making the environment less threatening, not on the minority. </p>

      <p>Now how about some solutions to this problem? I can only offer opinions and my own experiences (since I've not yet worked at a tech company), but I think it starts with everyone being more aware. This fits right into the Emotional Intelligence that DBC discusses; the engineering empathy idea. I believe that if you're a good person, you always strive to be a better one. Therefore, be more aware of your surroundings, be able to take criticism and turn it into healthy change, and acknowledge the uncomfortable. For instance, as a man, you SHOULD acknowledge your privilege, just like I acknowledge my inherited privilege of being white. It's ok to try to understand people's perspectives more deeply, and to sometimes find that you're being offensive even though you don't mean to be. A good working environment, especially a collaborative one, is where everyone feels equally heard and respected. I think when people are always around their own kind (men with men, etc.) they forget that equality and respect is something you have to be mindful of, and that doesn't just come naturally. </p>

      <p>I'll close with an example. I go to a Ruby on Rails meet-up. I'm ALWAYS the only woman, but I love the group of all men, especially the instructor. The first meeting I attended I ended up chatting with the instructor during our break. He said it was great that I was going into tech. I made an off-handed comment that yeah, I'm very excited, and everyone has been supportive so far, and there are some great resources for women. And then I said "Like, today, I'm usually the only woman at smaller meet-ups." He looked around and said "Oh, I didn't even notice you were the only woman." I know he meant well, and he's super kind, but this is where change needs to come: We all need to be more aware of, and accommodating to, those around us. Because while YOU don't feel anything is out of the ordinary, I'm back here acutely aware of my own presence in a room of people that I'm hoping want me there.  </p>
