    <h4>Let's talk about the two list-like elements in Ruby: the hash and the array. Which one do you use, and when?</h4>

  		<p style="padding-left: 30px; font-size: 18px;"><strong>[THE ARRAY]</strong></p>

      <p>Definition: <em>an Array is a list of items that is in a particular order.</em></p>

      <p>Most of the following info is taken from Udemy.com's blog, which I thought was a great resource and very well written:</p>

      <p><strong>Order matters!</strong></p> 

      <p>The first thing to learn about arrays is that they are ordered. An array starts at a specific point, goes forwards to the end, and then stops. Each one of the items in an array has specific address, and you can always count on each address being one higher than the previous address. This is one feature that makes arrays so useful. You can store anything in an array, and know that unless the array has been modified, whatever came before it will always come before it, and whatever comes after it will always come after it. Unlike some data structures, the ordering in an array is significant. You can depend on it.</p>

      <p><strong>Integer-Indexed</strong></p>

      <p>When they say that an array is integer indexed, what they mean is that each item in the array can be accessed by referencing an integer that represents its position in the array. The item referenced by passing any specific integer will always come back when you reference that specific integer, as long as the array has not been modified. This allows you to use an array as a list of items that will always be in the same order, and can always be referenced by their order.</p>

     <p><strong>Collections</strong></p>

     <p>An array is a collection, meaning that a single array is actually a reference in memory to a variety of other objects. An array can be empty, or it can have a huge number of objects in it, including other arrays, but it will still be the same single collection.</p>

     <p><strong>Collections of Any Object</strong></p>

     <p>One thing that makes Ruby different from some other languages is that an array can contain any type of legitimate Ruby object. Even if you create a new object type, an existing array can be used to hold one or more of that object. Arrays can also hold objects of different types, making them very flexible.</p>

    <p><strong>Zero-Indexed</strong></p>

    <p>Like many programming languages, Ruby uses a zero index for its arrays. What this means is that the first object in an array is indexed as iten number zero. The second object is item number one. And the address of the final object can be calculated by getting the length of the array, subtracting one, and using that as the index for that object.</p>

    <p><strong>Creating Arrays</strong></p>

    <p>Ruby makes it very easy to create an array. The syntax for an array is a set of square brackets. At its most basic, and empty array can be created just by assigning an empty set of square brackets to a variable like this: a = []. You can also create an array using the “new” method of the Array class, and passing the number of items that you want the array initialized with. <br /><br />

    a = Array.new<br />
    a = Array.new(20)<br /><br />
    
    Initializing an empty array with a number of items creates the space in memory for as many items as you want the array to hold when it is created, but arrays can grow and shrink as needed.</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 30px; font-size: 18px;"><strong>{THE HASH}</strong></p>

        <p>Definition: <em> a Hash is a collection of key-value pairs.</em></p>

        <p><strong>Order does NOT matter!</strong></p> 

      <p>The first thing to learn about hashes is that they are not ordered. While you can store anything in a hash, you cannot rely on the order in which you stored it. In other words, there is no way to know which element is in a certain position in the hash. The only important information is that each element has a key and a corresponding assigned value. This also means that, unlike an array, the positions are NOT integer-indexed.</p>

      <p><strong>Key/Value-Indexed</strong></p>

      <p>So how do we access a hash? By the key or the value, of course! If your key value pair is workers = {"employee" => "Jon"}, then to get the value of the specific key (which is "employee"), you must access it like so: workers["employee"]. This will return the value assigned to "employee". You can also type in workers["Jon"], and the value will be returned. Mostly, however, keys are used to search for values, and not the other way around.</p>

     <p><strong>Collections</strong></p>

     <p>A hash is also a collection, meaning that a single hash is actually a reference in memory to a variety of other objects. A hash can be empty, or it can have a huge number of objects in it, including other arrays, or hashes, but it will still be the same single collection.</p>

     <p><strong>Collections of Any Object</strong></p>

     <p>Just like for arrays, a hash can contain any type of legitimate Ruby object. Even if you create a new object type, an existing hash can be used to hold one or more of that object. Hashes can also hold objects of different types, making them very flexible.</p>

    <p><strong>Creating Hashes</strong></p>

    <p>Ruby makes it very easy to create a hash. The syntax for an array is a set of curly brackets. At its most basic, and empty hash can be created just by assigning an empty set of curly brackets to a variable like this: a = {}. You can also create an hash using the “new” method of the Hash class.<br /><br />

    a = Hash.new<br /><br />
    
    Hashes can grow and shrink as needed.</p>
        
    <p>The key-value pairs look like this: "employee" => "salary" or this "employee_age": 45 (you can use the => notation, or the : notation).</p>

    <p style="font-size:16px; ">***One last important note about hashes: the keys in a hash can ONLY correspond to their unique values. This means that "employee" cannot have multiple different values like this: <br />
      <br />

      workers = {"employee": "Jon", "employee": "Jane", "employee": "June"}. <br /><br />

    What this will do is override all the values but the last one, so that the only "employee" that gets stored is "June". In an array, however, this is not the case. An array can have multiple equivalent elements like so: workers = ["Jon", "Jon", "June", "Mary", "June"]. This is because the elements in an array work just like an ordered list, but the elements in a hash work like a dictionary. So think of it like this: a word can only have ONE unique definition, whereas a list can have the same word over and over.***</p>

     <p style="padding-left: 30px; font-size: 18px;"><strong>So When Should You Use an Array, and When Should You Use a Hash?</strong></p>

     <p>Use an array when you want to be able to iterate over it and change every element to meet new goals. Use a hash when you need unique keys, or identifiers, to represent unique values. For example, if you are storing data that is not associated with one object, maybe use an array. If you are storing data that revolves around an object, for instance a person that has a name, age, and location, then a hash would be of better service. Simple! </p>
