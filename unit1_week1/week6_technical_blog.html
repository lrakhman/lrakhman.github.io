      <h4>Procedural, and imperative, and declarative, and encapsulation, and orthogonal, and lambdas, and state, and side effects...Who's in way over her head when it comes to these functional vs. oop discussions? This girl.</h4>

    <section>
      <p>When researching the difference between functional and object-oriented programming, I did what most people would do: I googled it. I looked through some sources, got an idea of what each programming paradigm entailed (sort of), and then started researching more in-depth.</p> 

      <p>Well here's the thing: for a n00b like myself, some of the conversations I found about various programming styles were totally above my head. I had to go and look up many MANY terms, but I also just don't have the CS background to know WTF some of these people are talking about.</p> 

      <p>Here's a perfect example of the kind of trash (err, knowledgeable discourse) I found: </p> 

      <blockquote> "Functional programming is based on a declarative model and has its roots from lambda calculus. It offers a lot of great concepts which can be borrowed from more imperative languages like C++ and C#.<br /><br />

      Some examples include referential transparency, lambda functions, first class functions, lazy and eager evaluation, and immutability.<br /><br />

      If for nothing else learning functional programming is useful for the concepts that it contains. It will change the way you do programming and think about programming. And I would guess that in the future functional programming will be just as important as object oriented programming has been.<br /><br />

      To get started you can chose to use a pure functional language such as Haskell, or you can use a hybrid one like F#.<br /><br />

      <strong>What are some of the big differences, pros and cons of functional programming vs. object-oriented programming?</strong><br /><br />

      Well object oriented programming is nice because it allows you to model your complex problem into hierarchies so you can simplify the problem. But it becomes very hard when you start to consider multi threaded programming while using mutable objects. In such cases you need to use heavy use of synchronization objects and it's near impossible to perfect a large application.<br /><br />

      That's where functional programming comes in. Because of things like immutability functional programming really simplifies multi-threaded programs. It makes it almost trivially easy to parallelize something when you know that given input X to a function it will always output Y. Also you know that a variable (or value in functional programming) can't change mid use from another thread.</blockquote>

      <p>Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, okay, I get it! Why didn't you just say "referential transparency" in the first place!? I mean, what kind of idiot isn't intimately familiar with lambda calculus? What is this, amateur hour?</p>

      <p>I'm obviously being facetious, and I totally got some useful info from that quote, but my frustration lies in all the stuff I just don't really understand (like lazy and eager evaluation, etc.). While I can see how, in theory, mutable vs. immutable objects function, I really have a deep grasp of how to tell what is mutable, what is immutable, and HOW to implement those states. Speaking of states, it seems easy enough, but of course it's not! </p>
