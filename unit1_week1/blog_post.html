      <h4>I'm going to analyze, in terms of UX and design, these 3 websites: 
	    <ol>
		  <li><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com">The Atlantic</a>
		  </li> 
		  <li><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/">Think Progress</a>
		  </li>  
		  <li><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">Buzzfeed</a>
		  </li>
	   </ol>
      </h4>

  		<p>These are not by any means my favorite sites, but I visit each of them quite often, and for different reasons. I visit the first two for information, current events, in-depth journalism, etc. I visit Buzzfeed when my brain needs to shut off for a few minutes and read a list of stupid things like "30 Times You Wished You Were a Cat". I tried to think of what would make a website my favorite, and then realized that I don't interact with the web in that capacity. I go wherever the content is interesting. If the website looks like shit, then of course I'm less likely to go back, but it doesn't always prevent me from returning.</p> 

  		<p>Ok, now that that's out of the way, let's get to the actual sites. I'm going to start with www.theatlantic.com/. When going to the home page of this site the first thing that loads are 3 large images that are links to stories. But wait, one of the is an advertisement. I assume that's done so that the ad doesn't stick out from the rest of the page. The largest image, which is to the center-left of the page, is actually a rotating slideshow of images that correspond to articles. If you scroll down on the page, there are more images with captions under them, but smaller, and some listed from right to left, and some listed from top to bottom. There are a few sidebars with information such as "Most Popular" and "Writers".</p> 

  		<p>I think the website looks very streamlined and clean. The background is minimalist, just white, and there are no flourishes anywhere. The colors all come from the images, mostly. There is a certain seriousness that is conveyed. I believe that's because the purpose of the site is (again, mostly) to report on serious political, national, and international matters. The content is not meant to entertain, but to inform. It's easy to scroll, find articles, and browse. There are tabs at the top of the page, right under the header, that direct you to various categories like tech, politics, business, health, education, etc.</p> 

  		<p>After being on the site one should feel like they have read some important news from a reliable news source. I mostly feel angered and outraged by the things I read, but I do (mostly) trust that the information is as unbiased as it's going to get. At the very least, I feel like my time has been used productively because I have learned from what I read.</p> 

  		<p>I feel the same way about website #2, http://thinkprogress.org/. The two sites are actually quite similar, aesthetically. Everything is square, meanings blocks on top of blocks, either side to side or top to bottom. Think Progress feels a bit more contemporary; their blocks are a bit more styled than The Atlantic. The UX is geared toward a younger audience, I think. The Atlantic is still a print magazine, so maybe they are trying to reach a broader demographic than Think Progress. Think Progress also has the header with tabs that divide the page into categories, the content is a bit more radically left-leaning, and the colors are muted. Background is white, very image heavy like The Atlantic, and ads are also weaved in to minimize interruption of the page flow.</p> 

  		<p>Now to Buzzfeed! Holy hell, when I want to waste me some time this site is PERFECT. First of all, hellooooo sensory overload! Where should I look?!? The top, the center, the right side, the left side, SO MANY COLORS, so many images, looks at those yellow circles that move when I scroll over them! Ok, I'm tired, let's pick a section to focus on but OMG how can I focus when there's a picture of a naked lady on the right. But is she naked? No, not naked, false advertising. EVERYTHING IS A HEADLINE. EVERYTHING IS A LINK. I want to die and laugh at the same time. How is this relaxing??? I don't know, but I come back every time.</p> 

  		<p>On a serious note, everything is in blocks (like the previous two), but much smaller blocks that are shoved as close to each other as possible to fit as much crap on the page as Buzzfeed seems fit. Which is an eternity of crap. They have their sidebar of linked lists/videos/stories, and of course other categories as well. Aesthetically, it's kind of like a house of mirrors that's a bit easier to escape, but the super bright colors and IN-YOUR-FACE graphics kind of make it ok. I think the goal of Buzzfeed's site is the same as large retail stores: if you make them get lost, they'll spend more time here.</p> 

  		<p>I don't know that any of these sites solve any problems, but the approach to presenting content is certainly different. Buzzfeed is mostly entertainment and pop culture, so I think they incorporate that feel into their site. The other two are journalism based, and so incorporate an aura of authority into their sites.</p> 

  		<p>Overall, I think that UX and design should convey something about the site's goals and content, which each of these sites succeeds in doing.</p>
