      <h4>So many stereotypes to remember, so little time!</h4>

	 <div id="main">
      <p>I have a very good friend that is extremely intelligent. She has a PhD in Literature, is a tenured professor, and has published multiple books. We were talking shop one day, back when I was applying to PhD programs. I mentioned that when I spoke with my thesis advisor (in my MFA program) about which PhD programs I should apply to, he said that he thought I really only had a good chance at getting into UIC, University of Pittsburgh, and maybe University of Denver. He did NOT think I should apply to Northwestern University (where I was currently in a Master's program), Cornell, Carnegie Mellon, and University of Chicago. He thought that I was, as he put it, not prepared for the requirements at those schools. This upset me for obvious reasons.</p>

      <p>I complained to my friend that I believed my advisor did not think I was smart enough to attend top-tier schools. This was particularly painful since he was a. my freaking advisor and b. dissuading me from applying to the SAME university that accepted me into their Master's program. I asked her if she thought I could thrive at the places I mentioned above.</p>

      <p> That's when she said: "Lana, you can't listen to what people say about your intelligence. I've never felt smart enough in my entire life. No matter how much I know about any particular subject, I never feel smart enough. Even when someone tells me I'm smart, I don't fully believe it. So my only advice is to decide for yourself whether or not you're smart."</p>

      <p>This blew me away, because my estimation of her intelligence was far above her own estimation of it. I've never forgotten her admission, and this past week reminded me of that conversation.</p> 

      <p>After watching Claude Steele's video and reading previews of his book, <em>Whistling Vivaldi</em>, I now see that what my friend and I were discussing is actually very similar to stereotype threat.</p> 

      <p>But let me back up. I taught at various colleges for a few years; everything from English 101, to poetry, to American literature, to Rhetoric/Composition, to developmental English (which is for those that do not place into college-level courses). There was one essay that I always taught, because not only is it beautifully written, but it very successfully employs the use of pathos, logos, and ethos (which are important concepts in any English class). The essay is titled <a href="http://english115ahn.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/6/1/13615707/black_men_and_public_space.pdf">Black Men and Public Space</a> by Brent Staples. Here are the last 2 paragraphs of that essay: </p> 

      <blockquote style="text-align: justify; padding: 2%;">"Over the years, I learned to smother the rage I felt at so often being taken for a criminal. Not to do so would surely have led to madness. I now take precautions to make myself less threatening. I move about with care, particularly late in the evening. I give a wide berth to nervous people on subway platforms during the wee hours, particularly when I have exchanged business clothes for jeans. If I happen to be entering a building behind some people who appear skittish, I may walk by, letting them clear the lobby before I return, so as not to seem to be following them. I have been calm and extremely congenial on those rare occasions when I've been pulled over by the police.<br /><br />

      And on late evening constitutionals I employ what has proved to be an excellent tension-reducing measure: I whistle melodies from Beethoven and Vivaldi and the more popular classical composers. Even steely New Yorkers hunching toward nighttime destinations seem to relax, and occasionally they even join in the tune. Virtually everybody seems to sense that a mugger wouldn't be warbling bright, sunny selections from Vivaldi's Four Seasons. It is my equivalent to the cowbell that hikers wear when they know they are in bear country."
      </blockquote>

      <p>When I saw the reading material for this week, I immediately recognized the reference to Vivaldi. Staples' essay essentially details what it's like being a black man in public spaces, and how other people's projected beliefs affect his own existence. He consistently feels threatening AND threatened simultaneously.</p>

      <p>While I've never felt threatening, mostly because I'm a woman and I'm white and no one seems to be currently afraid of that combination (let's not forget history though, and the many men of color that have been wrongly imprisoned, executed, and lynched for merely looking at a white woman), I certainly understand what it's like to FEEL threatened.</p>

      <p>Either on a physical, emotional, or psychological level, stereotype threat is an insidious teacher. I never did apply to those programs, you see. And I still think that I'm not quite good at math, even though I took AP Math almost every year in high school. And if we're going to be brutally honest, I tense up when I'm walking alone at night and a man is walking anywhere near me. I tense up even more if that man fits a stereotype (rough looking, frat boy, black, large build, etc.). However much I try to logically convince myself that I'm profiling and stereotyping, and that I shouldn't be, my physical fear manifests itself regardless.</p>

      <p>That's the nature of the stereotype: it isn't logical. You know, with your brain, that Asian people are not bad drivers. You know that 99% of black men are not dangerous. That 99% of all men are not dangerous. That women are just as competent at math, science, and coding as men are. That children of color are not any dumber than white children. That women should be paid equally for their work, that poor people are not lazy, that Jews are not stingy, that white people do have rhythm, that women are good at sports, that sports are not just for black men, that Muslims are not terrorists, that the Irish are not drunks, etc., etc., for the love of god, etc.!</p>

      <p>But what's going on in your gut? What's happening at the visceral level, hmm? Learning all these caricatures takes time, and we all learn them SO very well. So well that my brain is no longer involved when a homeless person sits next to me on the train; my hand just seems to know to grasp my purse with anticipation. </p>

      <p>Which is total bullshit. This training can be unlearned, and must be unlearned, in order to move forward, to thrive, to live happily among the many different people you encounter on a daily basis. When I don't feel smart enough because I'm a woman in a historically male field and so I don't speak up, or I constantly doubt myself, that's a very real thing, and it isn't. The consequences are real, but the limitations are imagined. Why live according to someone else's expectations, since those expectations are also imagined? When did we start living reality based on fantasy?</p>

      <p>Staples and Steele would probably argue that our imaginations, and the stereotypes we engender, shape our reality; I absolutely agree with them. How do we re-shape it, though? My own reaction when I feel I'm being stereotyped is probably not unique: I get frustrated, and angry, and combative. And then I go home and berate myself for not being good enough, for making too many mistakes, for not picking up the material fast enough. </p>

      <p>What I should do, what I've been trying to do for the past few weeks, is to let go. To focus on what I'd like my reality to be, instead of being hyper-aware of how others perceive me. To stop. Breathe. Recalibrate. Remember how much I've learned in the past few months. Remember that I'm out of my comfort zone. Remember that in a year I'll look back and be in amazement of what I've accomplished. </p>

      <p>In his essay, Staples writes that he "... learned to smother the rage [he] felt at so often being taken for a criminal. Not to do so would surely have led to madness." Each day I attempt to smother my insecurities and my self-doubt; otherwise, it WILL lead to madness. I also try to acknowledge the deeply imbedded stereotypes that I've learned in order to alleviate someone else having to suppress their rage. Contributing to stereotypes is just as bad as being smothered by them.</p>

      <p>I'm very lucky to be on this path. I love what I do, and I can't wait to do it for a living. I know there will be ups and downs, so there is no space or time for limitations. Like Staples, I have my own (psychological) safeguards. He whistles because his threat is very real; he writes that "Where fear and weapons meet--and they often do in urban America--there is always the possibility of death." My threat is different; I have the luxury to refuse to whistle. And maybe if I don't whistle, if I unlearn to act in detrimental ways, those around me will eventually cease to do so as well. </p>
