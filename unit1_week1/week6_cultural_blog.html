      <h4>So many stereotypes to remember, so little time!</h4>

	  <section>
  		<p>I have a very good friend that is extremely intelligent. She has a PhD in Literature, is a tenured professor, and has published multiple books. We were talking shop one day, back when I was applying to PhD programs. I mentioned that when I spoke with my thesis advisor (in my MFA program) about which PhD programs I should apply to, he said that he thought I really only had a good chance at getting into UIC, University of Pittsburgh, and maybe University of Denver. He did NOT think I should apply to Northwestern University (where I was currently in a Master's program), Cornell, Carnegie Mellon, and University of Chicago. He thought that I was, as he put it, not prepared for the requirements at those schools. This upset me for obvious reasons.</p>

      <p>I complained to my friend that I believed my advisor did not think I was smart enough to attend top-tier schools. This was particularly painful since he was a. my freaking advisor and b. disuading me from applying to the SAME university that accepted me into their Master's program. I asked her if she thought I could thrive at the places I mentioned above.</p>

      <p> That's when she said: "Lana, you can't listen to what people say about your intelligence. I've never felt smart enough in my entire life. No matter how much I know about any particular subject, I never feel smart enough. Even when someone tells me I'm smart, I don't fully believe it. So my only advice is to decide for yourself whether or not you're smart.</p>

      <p>This blew me away, because my estimation of her intelligence was far above her own estimation of it. I've never forgotten her admission, and this past week reminded me of that conversation.</p> 

      <p>After watching Claude Steele's video and reading previews of his book, <em>Whistling Vivaldi</em>, I now see that what my friend and I were discussing is actually very similar to stereotype threat.</p> 

      <p>But let me back up. I taught at various colleges for a few years; everything from English 101, to poetry, to American literature, to Rhetoric/Composition, to developmental English(which is for those that do not place into college-level courses). There was one essay that I always taught, because not only is it beautifully written, but it very successfully employs the use of pathos, logos, and ethos (which are important concepts in any English class). The one essay is titled <a href="http://english115ahn.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/6/1/13615707/black_men_and_public_space.pdf">Black Men and Public Space</a> by Brent Staples. Here are the last 2 paragraphs of that essay: </p> 

      <blockquote style="text-align: justify;">"Over the years, I learned to smother the rage I felt at so often being taken for a criminal. Not to do so would surely have led to madness. I now take precautions to make myself less threatening. I move about with care, particularly late in the evening. I give a wide berth to nervous people on subway platforms during the wee hours, particularly when I have exchanged business clothes for jeans. If I happen to be entering a building behind some people who appear skittish, I may walk by, letting them clear the lobby before I return, so as not to seem to be following them. I have been calm and extremely congenial on those rare occasions when I've been pulled over by the police.<br /><br />

      And on late evening constitutionals I employ what has proved to be an excellent tension-reducing measure: I whistle melodies from Beethoven and Vivaldi and the more popular classical composers. Even steely New Yorkers hunching toward nighttime destinations seem to relax, and occasionally they even join in the tune. Virtually everybody seems to sense that a mugger wouldn't be warbling bright, sunny selections from Vivaldi's Four Seasons. It is my equivalent to the cowbell that hikers wear when they know they are in bear country."
      </blockquote>

      <p>When I saw the reading material for this week, I immediately recognized the reference to Vivaldi. </p>
