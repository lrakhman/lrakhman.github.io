    <h4>Let's answer some questions about pair programming!</h4>  

	  <div id="main">
  	<p>Pairing:<br /><br />

    >What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?<br /><br />

    I had a great time pairing with others. I love collaborating with people, and so working on a problem together with others is fun for me. It was a great learning experience as well, because I can sometimes fill the gaps in my knowledge with what my partner knows.<br /><br />

    >Was something particularly fun or rewarding?<br /><br />

    It was rewarding to find a good solution to the problems. The problems weren't super hard, so far, but it was nice to research and implement code that I wasn't super familiar with.<br /><br />

    >Was something frustrating and difficult for you?<br /><br />
    Nope, not so far. </p>
    
    <p>Feedback:<br /><br />

>How did you feel when you read your feedback?<br /><br />

I didn't get any feedback yet :(.<br /><br />

>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?<br /><br />

Not yet. <br /><br />

>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you 
pair?<br /><br />

N/A<br /><br />

>How was it to write feedback?<br /><br />
Writing feedback has not been very difficult because I've had great partners!<br /><br />

>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?<br /><br />
I didn't feel like I could really critique anything about the pair because everything went so smoothly.<br /><br />
>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?<br /><br />
Great idea, especially for people that like to collaborate creatively. I don't think it always works super well, but when two people are on the same page it's a great use of time.</p>
