      <h4>How to Avoid Getting Upset at DBC</h4>

    <section>
      <p>DISCLAIMER: I'm not a huge fan of this week's cultural blog topic, so this is going to be brief. And full of sass and sarcasm. </p> 

      <p>Enough with the feelings, already! I'm up for talking emotions and what not, but questions such as "What are you going to do when you feel down?" are just not useful. Here's the thing: I know what I USUALLY do when I feel down, but I don't know how/if that will help me at DBC.</p> 

      <p>Most of us are starting fresh. I have no background in CS, which is a bit scary. I get it: I'm supposed to set myself up for success by aknowledging my fears and insecurties, blah blah blah.</p> 

      <p>These questions/topics are becoming way too open-ended though. It feels like we're circumventing the real issues. I get frustrated by ambiguity; just ask me what you want to know/what me to think about. I'd much more appreciate exact questions such as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>How do you handle your anger when you are not living up to your standards?</li>
        <li>You will not succeed immediately at everything you try. How are you going to overcome the frustration that comes with not being to accomplish certain goals?</li>
        <li>You will not be the best one in our cohort. How will you deal with this?</li>
        <li>What if you are falling behind? How will you handle your perceived failures?</li></ul> 

      <p>Let me mention though, I'm coming up with these questions and scenarios before day one. So they could all be crap. I want guidance or wisdom concerning how to handle my annoyances, how to keep pushing myself when I feel like I'm drowning, etc. I hate these hypotheticals that I have to think about and prepare myself for. I've never tried doing something like this in my life, so I don't freakin' KNOW what I'm going to do when I'm down, ok? I guess I'll just figure it out on the spot. Sweets and wine ususally do the trick. Side note: My new goal is to code while a little bit drunk.</p>
