It's easy, fast and powerful. Adding JavaScript to your site doesn't require having access to a server, compiling programs, or having the browser load a virtual machine. You simply add JavaScript to your web pages and upload the page. Running the program is as simple as reloading the page in a browser. Even so, it gives you quite powerful access to many features of the web page, the browser and even the computer on which the script is running. Finally, it features an object-oriented architecture like Java and C++.
Ubiquity. Millions of people run browsers that can handle JavaScript--in some variation or another. JavaScript 1.0 is supported in Netscape 2 and Internet Explorer 3, and over the years both Netscape and Microsoft have extended the language and the underlying models to offer increased functionality. These later versions of JavaScript are at the heart of Dynamic HTML (DHTML).
Reduced server load. Before JavaScript any kind of interaction required sending messages back and forth between the browser and the server. JavaScript allows for many of these negotiations to be handled entirely on the client-side, leaving the server free for the important stuff beyond HTML. JavaScript is finding a place in many, many Internet applications, not all of them part of what we think of as a web page.

Furthermore, JavaScript is incorporated in Macromedia' Flash animation technology, Allaire's ColdFusion has integrated JavaScript into its XML-based technology, and JavaScript has been adopted as the design model for a standardized general-purpose scripting language, ECMA-262. In addition, JavaScript can interact with and control Java applets on a web page.

Beyond all this, developers are becoming more and more sophisticated in how they think about the language and what they do with it. While a few years ago most people thought of JavaScript as useful for controlling the presentation of a page, enabling nifty tricks like image rollovers, forms validation, controlling cookies, and randomizing content, developers are starting to think of JavaScript as a more full-featured language. Indeed, we can expect to see developers writing full-featured applications in JavaScript, unconfined by the yesterdays' notion of the language's limits.
