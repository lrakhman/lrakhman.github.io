      <h4>Well, here are some of the many good reasons:
	    <ol>
		  <li>It's the only ubiquitous client-side scripting language.</a>
		  </li> 
		  <li>Speed, power, and relatively easy to learn (or at least get started).</a>
		  </li>  
		  <li>Oh, the libraries!</a>
		  </li>
	   </ol>

  		<p>Let's start from #1. According to O'Reillynet.com, "Millions of people run browsers that can handle JavaScript--in some variation or another." That said, JavaScript is the most widely used, if not the only, client-side language. Why, you ask? This leads into point #2. Since JavaScript is not a compiled language, it doesn't need fancy programs to compile it. It is run right in the browser, which saves time, money, and power. Due to the fact that it doesn't need access to a server, adding JavaScript is super easy! It's also relatively easy to get a basic understanding of its functionality. Which, you guessed it, leads into reason #3. There are many very useful libraries that come with JavaScript. From another source: "JavaScript alone is a very fast and powerful language. It can do extremely complex things behind the scenes or manipulate aesthetics on web pages in ways you wouldnâ€™t believe. Still, some of these manipulations are difficult to design and construct. They require a lot of code and time to develop. To this end, developers have written several very good libraries to support the language and allow it to easily manipulate web pages with just a few lines of code." Some of these libraries include the well-known jQuery, MooTools, Prototype, and dojo.</p> 

      <p>Some other reasons that JS is so popular is because of AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. According to the Mozilla Developer Network: "While not a technology in itself, [AJAX] is a term that describes a "new" approach to using a number of existing technologies together, including: HTML or XHTML, Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, The Document Object Model, XML, XSLT, and most importantly the XMLHttpRequest object. When these technologies are combined in the Ajax model, web applications are able to make quick, incremental updates to the user interface without reloading the entire browser page. This makes the application faster and more responsive to user actions." Therefore, JavaScript is an important component of the AJAX approach.</p> 

      <p>Moreover, JS is easy to debug, and it is a perfect fit for the web, since it works seamlessly with HTML and CSS.
