				<p>I have lived in Chicago for most of my life (since I was 5). Here are some of my favorite things about this city:
				</p>
			<ol>
		  		<li>The lake!</li>
		  		<li>Fairly good cost of living.</li>
		  		<li>The different neighborhoods.</li>
		  		<li>It's so big that I'm always finding new things to do/places to go/people to meet.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<p>Here are some things that I don't like so much about this city:</p>
			<ul>
		  		<li>The cold weather (especially this year!)</li>
		  		<li>The segregation of all the neighborhoods.</li>
		  		<li>Some of the local politics/politicians (I'm looking at you, <em>Rahm</em>). </li>
		  		<li>The public transportation system, specifically on the south side and west side.</li>

	  		<h3><em>[Here Are Some Things That Define Me]</em></h3>
	   		<p>Yes, I love cats, now stop judging me.<br/> 
	    	I also love poetry, all types of books,<br/>
	    	 politics, reading (duh), history, gender <br/>
	    	 studies, the outdoors in nice weather, <br/>
	    	 and all things tech related. I also love <br/>
	    	 to teach. And here's a shout-out to my <br/>
	    	 hubby so he doesn't get sad: <a href= "http://cutearoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Kitten11.jpg" target="_self"><strong>Love you!</strong></a>
