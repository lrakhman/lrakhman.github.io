      <p>The new, cool kid on the block is NoSQL. She's so hip that people are friending her on Facebook left and right. Your old next door neighbor, SQL, is all: WTF community? Why you all be jumping on that non-relation train all of a sudden? Haters.</p> 

      <p>But before we get into this drama, let's define SQL, a relational database system, and NoSQL, a non-relational database system.</p> 

      <p>RELATIONAL DATABASE (SQL)

        <blockquote>"A relational database is a database that has a collection of tables of data items, all of which is formally described and organized according to the relational model. Data in a single table represents a relation, from which the name of the database type comes. In typical solutions, tables may have additionally defined relationships with each other.

        In the relational model, each table schema must identify a column or group of columns, called the primary key, to uniquely identify each row. A relationship can then be established between each row in the table and a row in another table by creating a foreign key, a column or group of columns in one table that points to the primary key of another table. The relational model offers various levels of refinement of table organization and reorganization called database normalization. The database management system (DBMS) of a relational database is called an RDBMS, and is the software of a relational database.

        In relational databases, each data item has a row of attributes, so the database displays a fundamentally tabular organization. The table goes down a row of items (the records) and across many columns of attributes or fields. The same data (along with new and different attributes) can be organized into different tables.

        The term relational does not just refer to relationships between tables: firstly, it refers to the table itself, or rather, the relationship between columns within a table; and secondly, it refers to links between tables."<br />

      <p>Cool, so what the heck is a NON-RELATIONAL DATABASE?

        <blockquote>"A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design, horizontal scaling and finer control over availability. The data structure (e.g., tree, graph, key-value) differs from the RDBMS, and therefore some operations are faster in NoSQL and some in RDBMS. There are differences though and the particular suitability of a given NoSQL DB depends on the problem to be solved (e.g., does the solution use tree algorithms?). 

        NoSQL databases are finding significant and growing industry use in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also referred to as "Not only SQL" to emphasize that they may in fact allow SQL-like query languages to be used. NoSQL stores often compromise consistency in favor of availability and partition tolerance. Barriers to the greater adoption of NoSQL data stores in practice include: the lack of full ACID transaction support, the use of low-level query languages, the lack of standardized interfaces, and the huge investments already made in SQL by enterprises."<br />

      <p>As we just learned, it's all about how the different pieces of data relate to one another, and also how individual tables relate to each other. I could go on and on, but I found this unbelievably helpful article on the subject, so here is everything summed up from the persective of a coder, as opposed to a database administrator: <a href="http://news.dice.com/2012/07/16/sql-vs-nosql-which-is-better/">SQL vs. NoSQL: Which Is Better?</a></p>
