      <h4>It's all about perspective, folks.</h4>

    <div id="main">
      <p>The new, cool kid on the block is NoSQL. She's so hip that people are friending her on Facebook left and right. Your old next door neighbor, SQL, is all: WTF community? Why you all jumping on that non-relational train all of a sudden? Haters.</p> 

      <p>But before we get into this drama, let's define SQL, a relational database system, and NoSQL, a non-relational database system.</p> 

      <p>RELATIONAL DATABASE (SQL)

        <blockquote>"A relational database is a database that has a collection of tables of data items, all of which is formally described and organized according to the relational model. Data in a single table represents a relation, from which the name of the database type comes. In typical solutions, tables may have additionally defined relationships with each other.

        In the relational model, each table schema must identify a column or group of columns, called the primary key, to uniquely identify each row. A relationship can then be established between each row in the table and a row in another table by creating a foreign key, a column or group of columns in one table that points to the primary key of another table. The relational model offers various levels of refinement of table organization and reorganization called database normalization. The database management system (DBMS) of a relational database is called an RDBMS, and is the software of a relational database.

        In relational databases, each data item has a row of attributes, so the database displays a fundamentally tabular organization. The table goes down a row of items (the records) and across many columns of attributes or fields. The same data (along with new and different attributes) can be organized into different tables.

        The term relational does not just refer to relationships between tables: firstly, it refers to the table itself, or rather, the relationship between columns within a table; and secondly, it refers to links between tables."<br />

      <p>Cool, so what the heck is a NON-RELATIONAL DATABASE?

        <blockquote>"A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design, horizontal scaling and finer control over availability. The data structure (e.g., tree, graph, key-value) differs from the RDBMS, and therefore some operations are faster in NoSQL and some in RDBMS. There are differences though and the particular suitability of a given NoSQL DB depends on the problem to be solved (e.g., does the solution use tree algorithms?). 

        NoSQL databases are finding significant and growing industry use in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also referred to as "Not only SQL" to emphasize that they may in fact allow SQL-like query languages to be used. NoSQL stores often compromise consistency in favor of availability and partition tolerance. Barriers to the greater adoption of NoSQL data stores in practice include: the lack of full ACID transaction support, the use of low-level query languages, the lack of standardized interfaces, and the huge investments already made in SQL by enterprises."<br />
        -- Wiki </blockquote></p> 

      <p>As we just learned, it's all about how the different pieces of data relate to one another, and also how individual tables relate to each other. I could go on and on, but I found this unbelievably helpful article on the subject, so here is everything summed up from the persective of a coder, as opposed to a database administrator: <a href="http://news.dice.com/2012/07/16/sql-vs-nosql-which-is-better/">SQL vs. NoSQL: Which Is Better?</a></p> 

      <p>Here are some other perks of NoSQL, according to the MongoDB website:

        <blockquote> NoSQL encompasses a wide variety of different database technologies and were developed in response to a rise in the volume of data stored about users, objects and products, the frequency in which this data is accessed, and performance and processing needs. Relational databases, on the other hand, were not designed to cope with the scale and agility challenges that face modern applications, nor were they built to take advantage of the cheap storage and processing power available today.<br /><br />

        <strong>NoSQL Database Types</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>Document databases pair each key with a complex data structure known as a document. Documents can contain many different key-value pairs, or key-array pairs, or even nested documents.</li>

        <li>Graph stores are used to store information about networks, such as social connections. Graph stores include Neo4J and HyperGraphDB.</li>

        <li>Key-value stores are the simplest NoSQL databases. Every single item in the database is stored as an attribute name (or "key"), together with its value. Examples of key-value stores are Riak and Voldemort. Some key-value stores, such as Redis, allow each value to have a type, such as "integer", which adds functionality.</li>

        <li>Wide-column stores such as Cassandra and HBase are optimized for queries over large datasets, and store columns of data together, instead of rows.</li>
      </ul>

        <strong>The Benefits of NoSQL</strong><br /><br />

        When compared to relational databases, NoSQL databases are more scalable and provide superior performance, and their data model addresses several issues that the relational model is not designed to address:

        <ul>
        <li>Large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data</li>
        <li>Agile sprints, quick iteration, and frequent code pushes</li>
        <li>Object-oriented programming that is easy to use and flexible</li>
        <li>Efficient, scale-out architecture instead of expensive, monolithic architecture</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Dynamic Schemas</strong><br /><br />

        Relational databases require that schemas be defined before you can add data. For example, you might want to store data about your customers such as phone numbers, first and last name, address, city and state – a SQL database needs to know what you are storing in advance.<br /><br />

          This fits poorly with agile development approaches, because each time you complete new features, the schema of your database often needs to change. So if you decide, a few iterations into development, that you'd like to store customers' favorite items in addition to their addresses and phone numbers, you'll need to add that column to the database, and then migrate the entire database to the new schema.<br /><br />

          If the database is large, this is a very slow process that involves significant downtime. If you are frequently changing the data your application stores – because you are iterating rapidly – this downtime may also be frequent. There's also no way, using a relational database, to effectively address data that's completely unstructured or unknown in advance.<br /><br />

          NoSQL databases are built to allow the insertion of data without a predefined schema. That makes it easy to make significant application changes in real-time, without worrying about service interruptions – which means development is faster, code integration is more reliable, and less database administrator time is needed.<br /><br />

          <strong>Auto-sharding</strong><br /><br />

          Because of the way they are structured, relational databases usually scale vertically – a single server has to host the entire database to ensure reliability and continuous availability of data. This gets expensive quickly, places limits on scale, and creates a relatively small number of failure points for database infrastructure. The solution is to scale horizontally, by adding servers instead of concentrating more capacity in a single server.<br /><br />

          "Sharding" a database across many server instances can be achieved with SQL databases, but usually is accomplished through SANs and other complex arrangements for making hardware act as a single server. Because the database does not provide this ability natively, development teams take on the work of deploying multiple relational databases across a number of machines. Data is stored in each database instance autonomously. Application code is developed to distribute the data, distribute queries, and aggregate the results of data across all of the database instances. Additional code must be developed to handle resource failures, to perform joins across the different databases, for data rebalancing, replication, and other requirements. Furthermore, many benefits of the relational database, such as transactional integrity, are compromised or eliminated when employing manual sharding.<br /><br />

          NoSQL databases, on the other hand, usually support auto-sharding, meaning that they natively and automatically spread data across an arbitrary number of servers, without requiring the application to even be aware of the composition of the server pool. Data and query load are automatically balanced across servers, and when a server goes down, it can be quickly and transparently replaced with no application disruption.<br /><br />

          Cloud computing makes this significantly easier, with providers such as Amazon Web Services providing virtually unlimited capacity on demand, and taking care of all the necessary database administration tasks. Developers no longer need to construct complex, expensive platforms to support their applications, and can concentrate on writing application code. Commodity servers can provide the same processing and storage capabilities as a single high-end server for a fraction of the price.<br /><br />

          <strong>Replication</strong><br /><br />

          Most NoSQL databases also support automatic replication, meaning that you get high availability and disaster recovery without involving separate applications to manage these tasks. The storage environment is essentially virtualized from the developer's perspective.<br /><br />

          <strong>Integrated Caching</strong><br /><br />

          A number of products provide a caching tier for SQL database systems. These systems can improve read performance substantially, but they do not improve write performance, and they add complexity to system deployments. If your application is dominated by reads then a distributed cache should probably be considered, but if your application is dominated by writes or if you have a relatively even mix of reads and writes, then a distributed cache may not improve the overall experience of your end users.<br /><br />

          Many NoSQL database technologies have excellent integrated caching capabilities, keeping frequently-used data in system memory as much as possible and removing the need for a separate caching layer that must be maintained.</blockquote></p>

          <p>This is a lot of new information to digest, and I can't say I have the best grasp on specifics, but I come away from this with the following wisdom: Don't pick sides just yet. Sometimes you want to party with the new kid, but sometimes your old trustworthy neighbor will do just fine.</p>
