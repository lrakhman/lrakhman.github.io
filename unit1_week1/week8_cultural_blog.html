       <h4>Success at DBC: What That Means and How to Prepare For It.</h4>

    <div id="main">
     
      <p>I'm writing this blog post while bone-achingly tired. I'm tired because I've just worked a little over 30 hours in 3 days, all on my feet. You see, I currently work at a busy, upscale restaurant where people expect the service to be quick, professional, and perfect. Did I mention quick?</p>

      <p>I've worked in restaurants since I was 15. It was my first job; it paid the bills through undergrad, and it paid the bills AND the tuition through grad school. Directly after grad school I left the service industry to teach, but when I decided that teaching was not going to pan out, I returned to work at that same restaurant.   </p>

      <p>The reason for this background information is to say that I am intimately aware of the attitude that Shereef describes in his fireside chat. I don't just understand the mindset of being in a restaurant, I have nightmares about that mindset. I put up with assholes on a daily basis that blame me for everything: the food being cooked incorrectly, the hostess seating them too close to the window, the busboy taking their plate prematurely because there were two crumbs left on it, the temperature being too hot, the temperature being too cold, the music being too loud, the traffic being too slow, their husband being a jerk, their friends being late, etc. If there's anger or frustration involved, I get the brunt of it. Why? Because they paid, of course. They paid for this meal, they got dressed up to come here, they even valeted their fucking car for twelve whole dollars! This means they have the right, no, they DESERVE, to take out all of life's little, shitty problems on me. If there's blame to be had, it will be dumped, steaming and unrestrained, in my general direction.</p>

       <p>But what's funny is that when I started teaching college English I naively thought that this was a thing of the past. I was always the model student who respected her professors, who did all the homework, who participated in discussion, and who was pretty excited to be in class. This, I foolishly thought, was exactly how other students handled college and education.</p>

       <p>Umm, no. Not even close.</p>

       <p>Sure, there's the odd one here and there that does what you ask, that reads the syllabus, that hands in their homework on time, that respects the fact that class starts at 9am and not at 9:15 (comedic relief: I once had a student that wrote on my teacher evaluation that I "was too strict about when class started, because, come on, it starts at 8am, so she can't possibly expect us to be there on time because come on, that's dumb and unfair.")</p>

       <p>What I wasn't prepared for was the consumer mindset. Education is now a business, but either no one told me, or I was in complete denial. The consumer mindset makes it ok for a student, for multiple students over the course of 2 years, to NOT KNOW MY GODDAMNED NAME BY THE END OF THE SEMESTER. To not turn in a single essay, but want a passing grade. To say things like "This doesn't interest me, and because I'm paying for this class, I shouldn't have to do things that are boring." To come into a 90 minute class 30 minutes late and demand to make up the points that were missed. To say that because the bus takes 25 minutes to get to the college, he/she will be coming into class 15 minutes late everyday instead of taking AN EARLIER BUS. To expect several extensions on all the papers because they have so much homework in their other classes. And let's talk about the grandparent GENOCIDE that occurs during midterm week and finals week. Holy shit, so many grandparents die. Some of them die multiple times. </p>

       <p>Some students have difficult lives, and while I'm generalizing here, I always handle every student on a case-by-case basis. However, the idea that because they're paying for their education they deserve certain allowances is absurd. They want class to be "fun, easy, and quick." When I explain that education, true education, is not either of those things, they roll their eyes. Their consumer mindset whispers in their collective ears "those who pay get to have a say. If you purchase this product, you decide how to consume it."</p>

       <p>The way people act in a restaurant is so close to how they act in a school that sometimes I was close to asking my students if they wanted fries with that lecture. And while I'm nowhere near perfect, I know, from years of experience, that not a single person owes me anything because I paid them, especially not a teacher. My education is solely on my shoulders. Besides, anything worth learning can't be bought. Yes, I'm paying to be taught some technical things, but what I've already learned is that I'm capable of a huge, scary change; that I am not defined by my job/career; that I love learning just for the sake of learning; and that I can be creative in ways I've never before dreamed. </p>

       <p>My education is what I make it. DBC will be what I make it. I am SO ready for this ride.</p>
