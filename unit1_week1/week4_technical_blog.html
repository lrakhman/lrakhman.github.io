    <h4>What's one of the most useful, important, and common methods in Ruby? Let's MAP out the answer (get it, get it?)!</h4>  

    <section>
      <p>The definiton of Ruby's .map method is as follows (from Ruby Docs): Returns a new array with the results of running block once for every element in enum. If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.</p>

      <p>Umm, ok, but what does that really MEAN? Here is a much better explanation, from stackoverflow.com: <br /><br />

        The map method takes an enumerable object and a block, and runs the block for each element, outputting each returned value from the block. It is an non-destructive method. <br /><br /></p>

      <p>Ok, from that explanation we figure out that the .map method builds a new array of the RESULTS FROM ITERATING OVER EACH ELEMENT. Let's look at some examples for clarification. If you have <br /><br />

       my_array = [1, 2, 3]<br />
       my_array.map { |i| i + 1 } # => [2, 3, 4]<br />
       puts my_array # => [1, 2, 3]<br /><br /></p>

       <p>Great, so .map will not mutate the original object, but will give you a new object. What about .map! (with the bang)? </p>



Real example:

def separate_comma(num)
  num_array = num.to_s.chars.reverse
  final_num = num_array.each_slice(3).map {|x| x.join }
  final_num.join(",").reverse
end
