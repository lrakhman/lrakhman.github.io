    <h4>What's one of the most useful, important, and common methods in Ruby? Let's MAP out the answer (get it, get it?)!</h4>  

    <section>
      <p>The definiton of Ruby's .map method is as follows (from Ruby Docs): Returns a new array with the results of running block once for every element in enum. If no block is given, an enumerator is returned instead.</p>

      <p>Umm, ok, but what does that really MEAN? Here is a much better explanation, from stackoverflow.com: <br /><br />

        The map method takes an enumerable object and a block, and runs the block for each element, outputting each returned value from the block. It is an non-destructive method. <br /><br /></p>

      <p>Ok, from that explanation we figure out that the .map method builds a new array of the RESULTS FROM ITERATING OVER EACH ELEMENT. Let's look at some examples for clarification. If you have <br /><br />

       my_array = [1, 2, 3]<br />
       my_array.map { |i| i + 1 } # => [2, 3, 4]<br />
       puts my_array # => [1, 2, 3]<br /><br />

       Great, so .map will not mutate the original object, but will give you a new object. What about .map! (with the bang)? That one, as you've probably already guessed, will indeed change the original object.</p>

       <p>But there's way more, sorry. This method even has it's own Wikipedia article! Check this crazyness out (from Wiki): "The map function originated in functional programming languages but is today supported (or may be defined) in many procedural, object oriented, and multi-paradigm languages as well: In C++'s Standard Template Library, it is called transform, in C# (3.0)'s LINQ library, it is provided as an extension method called Select. Map is also a frequently used operation in high level languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby; the operation is called map in all three of these languages. A collect alias for map is also provided in Ruby.

       If that's not enough for you, here's the link to the entire article:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_%28higher-order_function%29">here</a></p>

       <p>Now let's tackle the next issue: when would someone use the .map method as opposed to other methods that iterate over arrays/hashes, like .each and .select?</p>

       <p>Let's take a look at a real-world example. How would you take a number of any length and insert commas into it to then return a string of that number? For example, if I input 8765432, I need it to output "8,765,432". This is the code that would accomplish this:<br /><br />
       def separate_commas(num)
       num.to_s.chars.reverse.each_slice(3).map(&:join).join(",").reverse <br />
       end <br />

       </p>
