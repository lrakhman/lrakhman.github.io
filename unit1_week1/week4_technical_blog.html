    <h4>What's one of the most useful, important, and common methods in Ruby? Let's MAP out the answer (get it, get it?).</h4>  

    <section>
      <p>The definiton of Ruby's .map method is as follows: </p>

      the .each method will iterate through
# the array/hash and alter each element one at a time, but it will RETURN THE ORIGINAL ARRAY/HASH.
# Meaning, it will not return the result of what was altered. The .map method, on the other
# hand, builds a new array of the RESULTS FROM ITERATING OVER EACH ELEMENT. For example,
# if you have [1, 2, 3].each { |x| x + 1 } it will add 1 to each element and then throw those
# results away, only to return [1, 2, 3]. But if you do [1, 2, 3].map { |i| i + 1 } the return
# value is [2, 3, 4]. FUCK YES KNOWLEDGE. 

Real example:

def separate_comma(num)
  num_array = num.to_s.chars.reverse
  final_num = num_array.each_slice(3).map {|x| x.join }
  final_num.join(",").reverse
end
