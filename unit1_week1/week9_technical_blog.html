      <h4>The Magic of AJAX - Building Interactive and Dynamic Websites</h4>

    <div id="main">

      <p>Everyone wants their web apps and websites to look the best, do amazing things, and handle millions, if not billions, of users on a daily basis. When learning how to build dynamic and interactive websites one comes across something called AJAX. First, let's define this term, courtesy of Wikipedia:</p>

       <blockquote>
      AJAX is a group of interrelated Web development techniques used on the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, Web applications can send data to, and retrieve data from, a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. Data can be retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest object. Despite the name, the use of XML is not required; JSON is often used instead, and the requests do not need to be asynchronous.[2]

      Ajax is not a single technology, but a group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The DOM is accessed with JavaScript to dynamically display, and allow the user to interact with, the information presented. JavaScript and the XMLHttpRequest object provide a method for exchanging data asynchronously between browser and server to avoid full page reloads.
       </blockquote>
      
      <p>As mentioned in the title, AJAX is an acronym for <strong>A</strong>synchronous <strong>J</strong>avaScript <strong>A</strong>nd <strong>X</strong>ML</p>. We all know what JavaScript is. Some of us might now what XML (and JSON) is (but if not, more info <a href="http://www.copterlabs.com/blog/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/"></a>here.) 




Ajax uses XHTML for content and CSS for presentation, as well as the Document Object Model and JavaScript for dynamic content display.

Conventional web application trasmit information to and from the sever using synchronous requests. This means you fill out a form, hit submit, and get directed to a new page with new information from the server.

With AJAX when submit is pressed, JavaScript will make a request to the server, interpret the results and update the current screen. In the purest sense, the user would never know that anything was even transmitted to the server.

XML is commonly used as the format for receiving server data, although any format, including plain text, can be used.

AJAX is a web browser technology independent of web server software.

A user can continue to use the application while the client program requests information from the server in the background

Intuitive and natural user interaction. No clicking required only Mouse movement is a sufficient event trigger.

Data-driven as opposed to page-driven
