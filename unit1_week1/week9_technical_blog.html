      <h4>The Magic of AJAX - Building Interactive and Dynamic Websites.</h4>

    <div id="main">

      <p>Everyone wants their web apps and websites to look the best, do amazing things, and handle millions, if not billions, of users on a daily basis. When learning how to build dynamic and interactive websites one comes across something called AJAX. First, let's define this term, courtesy of Wikipedia:</p>

       <blockquote>
      AJAX is a group of interrelated Web development techniques used on the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, Web applications can send data to, and retrieve data from, a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. Data can be retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest object. Despite the name, the use of XML is not required; JSON is often used instead, and the requests do not need to be asynchronous.[2]

      Ajax is not a single technology, but a group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The DOM is accessed with JavaScript to dynamically display, and allow the user to interact with, the information presented. JavaScript and the XMLHttpRequest object provide a method for exchanging data asynchronously between browser and server to avoid full page reloads.
       </blockquote>
      
      <p>As mentioned in the title, AJAX is an acronym for asynchronous JavaScript and XML. We all know what JavaScript is. Some of us might now what XML (and JSON) is (but if not, more info <a href="http://www.copterlabs.com/blog/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/">here</a>.) But more importantly, <strong>what does "asynchronous" mean?</strong></p> 

      <blockquote>
      "Asynchronous refers to events that are happening on the background independently of the main application flow. These events do not disturb the flow of the application, allowing the continuation of its normal process. A fairly good example of this happening is in your Facebook home page, when all of a sudden, without refreshing your browser window, you notice that there are new status feed updates from your friends. So what happens there is, Facebook sends your profile information (or your user id) to their servers. Their servers then look for your friends list, grab their newly added status, return the result to the browser, and then add them to your wall so that you can see. All of that, without pressing the refresh button. 

      (Although I did notice, and think many have as well, how they do implement this. If you haven’t, then try leaving your Facebook homepage on the browser without moving your mouse for about 1 minute. After that minute, just move your mouse from one point to another, and all of a sudden, you will see the feeds get updated. I’m assuming they are using some jQuery mousemove or something similar for this to happen.)

      So you see, AJAX allows you to update a web page asynchronously in the background by exchanging simple and small amounts of data. Some more examples of pages using AJAX are: Youtube, Gmail, Google Maps, and StackOverflow." - codeproject.com(jotorres)

      <p>Great, now that we understand (mostly) the 3 main components of AJAX, let's map out some exact steps that will be followed when you use it (thanks to noupe.com). Here is how the usual AJAX script works: </p>

      <ul style="list-style-type: square;">

      <li>Some action triggers the event, like the user clicking a button or moving the mouse.</li>

      <li>The AJAX call fires, and sends a request to a server-side script, using XML or JSON.</li>

      <li>The server-side script (PHP, ASP, or whatever) takes the input from JavaScript, can access the database if it needs to, and processes the data.</li>

      <li>Using XML/JSON again, the script sends the data back to the original client-side page that made the request.</li>

      <li>A second JavaScript function, called a callback function, catches the data, and updates the web page.</li>
      </ul>


    <p>If you're like me, and end up sort of bewildered by all this information, you'll need someone to walk you through a step by step tutorial (also, you'll need a decent grasp of JSON/XML and JavaScript). After looking through multiple videos online, I found this one from <a href="lynda.com">lynda.com</a>, which is an excellent website for all things tech-related. You'll need to have a subscription for some of the materials, but many of them are free. Here's an introduction to AJAX with JavaScript video, which I hope is helpful:</p>
