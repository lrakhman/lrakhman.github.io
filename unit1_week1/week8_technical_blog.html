      <h4>Try Searching "Recursion" in Google, and See If You Get the Nerd Joke.</h4>

    <div id="main">
      <p>Instead of pretending that I have a good grasp of how to use recursion, I'm simply going to define it, and say that I'm super interested in the theory behind it. First, the definition:

    <blockquote>
      <strong>Recursion</strong> "is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. For instance, when the surfaces of two mirrors are exactly parallel with each other the nested images that occur are a form of infinite recursion. The term has a variety of meanings specific to a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, in which it refers to a method of defining functions in which the function being defined is applied within its own definition. Specifically this defines an infinite number of instances (function values), using a finite expression that for some instances may refer to other instances, but in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur. The term is also used more generally to describe a process of repeating objects in a self-similar way." - Wiki
    </blockquote>

<p>This, taken from another source, is a great explanation as well: "Sometimes a problem is too difficult or too complex to solve because it is too big. If the problem can be broken down into smaller versions of itself, we may be able to find a way to solve one of these smaller versions and then be able to build up to a solution to the entire problem. This is the idea behind recursion; recursive algorithms break down a problem into smaller pieces which you either already know the answer to, or can solve by applying the same algorithm to each piece, and then combining the results.</p>

<p>Stated more concisely, a recursive definition is defined in terms of itself. Recursion is a computer programming technique involving the use of a procedure, subroutine, function, or algorithm that calls itself in a step having a termination condition so that successive repetitions are processed up to the critical step where the condition is met at which time the rest of each repetition is processed from the last one called to the first." (sparknotes)

 <p>The above resource has some really good introductory information, such as a very general descriptino of when to use recursion vs. iteration, and a step-by-step breakdown of how a recursive function works. I highly recommend reading it here: <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/cs/recursion/whatisrecursion/section1.rhtml">SparkNotes</a>.</p>
