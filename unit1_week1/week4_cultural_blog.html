      <h4>Let's talk about our feelings!</h4>
	    

	  <section>
    
<p>I'm going to answer the following questions as honestly as humanly possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</li>
<li>What was the source of the conflict?</li>
<li>How did you handle that conflict?</li>
<li>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</li>
<li>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</li>
<li>What did you learn from this experience?</li>
</ul>
