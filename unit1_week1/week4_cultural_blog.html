      <h4>Let's talk about our feelings!</h4>

<p>I'm going to answer the following questions as honestly as humanly possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</li>
<li>What was the source of the conflict?</li>
<li>How did you handle that conflict?</li>
<li>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</li>
<li>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</li>
<li>What did you learn from this experience?</li>
</ul>

<p>I've been lucky enough to mostly avoid conflicts with people. I'm not a confrontational person, and I usually look to sooth rather than incite. However, as a former professor, I've had my share of conflict with students (which is unavoidable, regardless of teaching style). </p>

<p>I once had a student that I'll call Susuan. Susan was a bright pupil, with an outgoing personality and lots of charm. But Susan was calculating. She would try to manipulate situations to her benefit, regardless of rules or expectations. </p>

<p>The class she was in was called Rhetoric 102, which concentrated on the research essay. I spent countless days going over the fact that every single paper that was to be submitted for the class was to be a research paper with a bibliography. The entire syllabus was populated with instructins such as: "No opinion papers. All papers must be based on research and logic/persuasion." </p>  	

<p>On the day that paper #1 was due all the students had to bring a copy of their paper in order to exchange it with their neighbors for the purposes of a peer-review. Susan had her paper ready, and was excited to announce that she was very proud of it, and that it was her best paper yet. </p>

<p>Just before I went to collect all the papers, she raised her hand to ask me a question: "Professor Rakhman, did we have to use research for this paper?" I replied that yes, of course, because every paper requires research with outside sources. She said something along the lines of "Well, I didn't know that. Where does it say that?" I replied again that all the work we had been doing in class was research-based, and that not only are the paper requirements written on the syllabus, but they are also written on the handouts that I gave. At this she got upset. She announced, to myself and the class, that it was unclear what needed to be done for the paper, and that she needed more specific guidance. She said that it would be unfair if she got deducted points for this oversight, because it was not her fault.</p>

<p>I asked the class who else had come with a paper that used no research. No one raised their hand. I then calmly explained that since the rest of the class understood the instructions, that perhaps they were indeed clear enough, and that if she has further questions and was unsure about what to do she is welcomed to email me or to see me outside of class for more guidance. </p>
