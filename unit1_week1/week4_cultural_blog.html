      Once you've opened your file, write a response to each exercise using the HTML you've learned to set up the file:

Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?
What was the source of the conflict?
How did you handle that conflict?
Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?
If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
What did you learn from this experience?
