      <h4>Let's talk about our feelings!</h4>
	    

	  <div id="main">
    
<p>I'm going to answer the following questions as honestly as humanly possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</li>
<li>What was the source of the conflict?</li>
<li>How did you handle that conflict?</li>
<li>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</li>
<li>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</li>
<li>What did you learn from this experience?</li>
</ul>

<p>I've been lucky enough to mostly avoid conflicts with people. I'm not a confrontational person, and I usually look to sooth rather than incite. However, as a former professor, I've had my share of conflict with students (which is unavoidable, regardless of teaching style). </p>

<p>I once had a student that I'll call Susan. Susan was a bright pupil, with an outgoing personality and lots of charm. But Susan was calculating. She would try to manipulate situations to her benefit, regardless of rules or expectations. </p>

<p>The class she was in was called Rhetoric 102, which concentrated on the research essay. I spent countless days going over the fact that every single paper that was to be submitted for the class was to be a research paper with a bibliography. The entire syllabus was populated with instructions such as: "No opinion papers. All papers must be based on research and logic/persuasion." </p>    

<p>On the day that paper #1 was due all the students had to bring a copy of their paper in order to exchange it with their neighbors for the purposes of a peer-review. Susan had her paper ready, and was excited to announce that she was very proud of it, and that it was her best paper yet. </p>

<p>Just before I went to collect all the papers, she raised her hand to ask me a question: "Professor Rakhman, did we have to use research for this paper?" I replied that yes, of course, because every paper requires research with outside sources. She said something along the lines of "Well, I didn't know that. Where does it say that?" I replied again that all the work we had been doing in class was research-based, and that not only are the paper requirements written on the syllabus, but they are also written on the handouts that I gave. At this she got upset. She announced, to myself and the class, that it was unclear what needed to be done for the paper, and that she needed more specific guidance. She said that it would be unfair if she got deducted points for this oversight, because it was not her fault.</p>

<p>I asked the class who else had come with a paper that used no research. No one raised their hand. I then calmly explained that since the rest of the class understood the instructions, that perhaps they were indeed clear enough, and that if she had further questions and was unsure about what to do she was welcomed to email me or to see me outside of class for more guidance. </p>

<p>At this point she was visibly angry. She said ok, but interrupted me throughout the class, kept sighing and rolling her eyes, making comments underneath her breath, and being disruptive and disrespectful throughout the day. I finally had to pull her aside while the rest of the students were working on their peer-reviews. </p>

<p>I asked her to step out into the hallway, and point-blank asked her why she was acting up. I told her that it was unacceptable to speak to a teacher in that manner, and that if she had a problem she could most certainly discuss it with me in private, not in public.</p>

<p>She said that she felt like she was being attacked. She said that she felt stupid for not understanding the assignment, and that she felt like I was trying to make her feel stupid because I asked other people if they had the same misunderstanding.</p>

<p>At this I softened up a bit. I explained to her that my intentions were not at all to make her feel stupid, and that I was sorry if that's how it came across. I said that I believed she was an intelligent, hard-working student, but that I also thought she should pay more attention to details and directions, because this was a common occurrence.</p>

<p>After that, she seemed to calm down. She apologized for acting like a (in her words) "bitch", and said that she understood that I wasn't attacking her personally, and that yes, she needed to make more of an effort to listen and take notes. She said she struggled sometimes but was too embarrassed to ask for help.</p>

<p>I told her that I would help her in any way I could, and that I respected her honesty. I told her that no-one knows everything, and that being ashamed of not understanding something will never be productive; that asking questions even at the risk of sounding stupid is better in the long run than constantly feeling left behind. </p>

<p>Susan and I turned a corner that day. She wasn't problem-free the rest of the semester, but she was a much better student.</p>

<p>When I think back on what happened, I think I could have been more sensitive to her insecurities. I think I handled that situation as best I knew how for a new teacher, but in the future I was more careful when talking to students in front of their peers. I also learned that I quickly forget what it's like to be new to something; to be the learner, not the teacher. I have to take my own advice now more than ever - put yourself out there, regardless of shame. I'd rather admit my lack of knowledge and insufficiencies than be limited by them. </p>
