    <h4>I'm going to explore my values, and discuss what they mean to me.</h4>  

	  <section>
  		<p>Exercise 1:<br />

        <strong>When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</strong><br /><br />

        Accomplishment Accountability Achievement Activism Adventure Affection Ambition Autonomy Challenge Close relationships Commitment Community Compassion Competence Competition Confidence Conformity Control Coolness under fire Cooperation Courage Creativity Credibility Decisiveness Economic security Effectiveness Efficiency Enthusiasm Environmentalism Excellence Excitement Fairness Faith Fame Free time Freedom Friendships Growth Having a family Health Helping other people Helping society Honesty Hospitality Independence Influence Inner harmony Insight Inspiration Integrity Intellectual status Introspection Justice Knowledge Leadership Location Loyalty Meaningful work Mentorship Merit Money Movement Music Nature Openness Order Patriotism Peace Persistance Personal development Physical challenge Pleasure Power and authority Privacy Public service Purity Quality Recognition Reputation Responsibility Romance Security Self-knowledge Self-reliance Self-respect Serenity Sophistication Spirituality Stability Status Tranquility Truth Vibrancy Volunteering Wealth Will-power Wisdom [add any that I missed]</p> 

        <p><strong>Here are the values I picked:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accomplishment</li>
          <li>Achievemtent</li>
          <li>Commitment</li>
          <li>Confidence</li>
          <li>Creativity</li>
          <li>Health</li>
          <li>Helping those in need</li>
          <li>Wisdom</li>
        </ul>

      <p>Exercise 2:<br />

        <strong>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</strong></p> 

        I'm going to write about <em>creativity</em>. Being creative (whether writing, painting, problem-solving, or building something) has always been key in my life. I am really happy when I am challenged creatively, and when I find solutions to those challenges. I'm a trained poet, and this means that when I create something that works well it makes me super happy. Above all, I like to use my brain. It's very important for me to consistently use my skills and knowledge at work, because when I get bored I get lazy! Which is a fault, but one that I've learned to avoid. Creatively speaking, I'm at my best when challenged to think outside of the proverbial box and to come up with ideas that seek to solve multiple problems at once. That's why creativity is so important to me: I believe it's a value that allows me to thrive. 

      <p>Exercise 3:<br />

        <strong>Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:</strong><br />

        In general, I try to live up to these values:<br />

        Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</p> 

        <p>Of course I try to live up to the values I chose, otherwise why choose them? 5 all the way.</p>

      <p>Exercise 4:<br />

        <strong>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</strong></p> 

        <p>The last topic that someone asked my advice on was actually tech-related stuff. Crazy how just a few months ago I knew very little, and now my friend is asking me to help re-design her site! I told her that it would take me a lot longer to be able to really help her, but I could change a few things here and there, and I actually discussed the look and feel of the site (she needs something very professional looking). It also really helped explaining some things to her, because articulating tech concepts aloud reinforced how I understood them. Which I guess is the point of these blogs, right? :).</p>
